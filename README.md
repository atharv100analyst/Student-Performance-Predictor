# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict student academic performance based on various behavioral and academic features.  

Using Machine Learning models, the system analyzes student data and predicts performance categories or outcomes.

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

The model is trained using the following features:

- 📚 Hours_Studied  
- 🏫 Attendance  
- 😴 Sleep_Hours  
- 📈 Previous_Scores  

These features help determine student performance patterns.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The models were trained and evaluated using train-test split methodology.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Feature Importance (for Random Forest)

👉 Random Forest performed better compared to Logistic Regression in terms of overall accuracy and prediction stability.
